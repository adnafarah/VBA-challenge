# VBA-challenge

This is an Excel VBA script that was used on a spreadsheet (workbook with multiple sheets) that contained stock data. The script loops through each of the stocks 
and then outputs the ticker symbol, the volume of stock, the opening price for each stock at the start of the year and the closing price for each stock at the end of 
the year. From there, it creates a table that outputs the ticker symbol, the yearly change from the opening price at the start of the year to the closing price at the
end of the year, the % change from opening price at the start of the year vs closing price at the end of the year & the total stock volume. Conditional formatting was applied via the script on the 'Yearly Change' column: cells with positive changes are highlighted in green & cells with negative changes are highlighted in red.  

A second table is created by the spreadsheet to return the stocks with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and the greatest total volume.  

The script will run on each sheet of the workbook. 

Uploaded are screenshots of the each sheet's first few rows, along with the tables that were created & the VBA script.
